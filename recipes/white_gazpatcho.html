        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Let bread, cashews, and water stand in a high-powered blender 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add chopped cucumbers, grapes, garlic, vinegar, and salt to blender; purée until mostly smooth, about 1
                minute. With motor running, drizzle in olive oil; purée until smooth, about 30 seconds more. Chill, covered,
                about 1 hour. Serve soup drizzled with additional olive oil and garnished with chives, sliced grapes, and/or
                sliced cucumbers.</li>

    <h2>Cucumbers play the part of tomatoes in this bright blended soup and—with the help of grapes—lend a sweet, fresh
        flavor. Cashews provide body without adding dairy.</h2>
    <p>Gazpacho (Spanish: [ɡaθˈpatʃo]) or Gaspacho (Portuguese: [ɡɐʃˈpaʃu]), also called Andalusian gazpacho, is a cold
        soup and drink made of raw, blended vegetables.[1] It originated in the southern regions of the Iberian
        peninsula and spread into other areas. Gazpacho is widely eaten in Spain and Portugal, particularly during hot
        summers, since it is refreshing and cool.
    </p>
    <p>Although there are other recipes called gazpacho, such as gazpacho manchego, the standard usage implies a soup.
        There are also a number of dishes that are closely related and often considered variants thereof, such as
        ajoblanco, salmorejo, pipirrana, porra antequerana (closer to a bread soup), and cojondongo</p>
